# Kepler-210 Multi-Planetary System Simulation

Dynamic simulation of 
[Kepler-210](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/overview/kepler%20210)
exoplanetary system. The initial keplerian orbital elements are calculated
fitting the light curve, system is propagated with Newton's 2nd law, with no
perturbations.
